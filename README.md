# icepop

`icepop` is a rewrite of [`riscvemu`](https://github.com/jmpnz/riscvemu) in Rust
with dynamic translation (x86 JIT) aimed towards emulating full RISC-V binaries
with ~hooks and introspection.~

Currently supports dynamic translation to x86, with aarch64 a work in progress.

Hooking and introspection are currently not implemented.
